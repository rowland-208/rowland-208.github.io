Have you struggled with using todo lists?
Have you tried creating a todo list only to find new items get added faster than you can complete existing items?
I can handle a fresh todo list just fine.
I would even say I find a fresh todo list envigorating.
But the longer I keep a list open,
the longer the list gets,
and eventually the list gets so long that I don't know where to start.
At that point I'm back to not having a todo list at all.

As a solution to this problem I was inspired to create a todo list with Elo ratings.
I thought it would help me sort my todo lists and finally get them under control. 
Important items would bubble up to the top by participating in duels (hence the name Duelo).
You might ask yourself "why don't you just look at the list and sort it?"
To that I would reply "I have ADHD so looking at a list with more than 10 items is overwhelming."
The duel mechanism forces me to focus on one pair of items at a time.
My ADHD riddled brain can handle prioritizing two things just fine.
You can try it yourself at https://rowland-208.github.io/duelo/.

The Elo rating system has nice features for augmenting a todo list.
* Priorities change from day to day. The Elo system accomodates this by allowing voting even after a list is sorted. The order updates continuously.
* The more votes you cast, and the more items in your list, the more effective the system becomes. The system learns your preferences.
* New items get sorted quickly by competing with existing items. A new item does not need to compete with all existing items to get an accurate rating.
* Voting is efficient. Votes for a pair can be cast without knowing scores of other items. Voting is O(1) in compute and memory.

My friends and I enjoyed using it to rank our favorite restaurants, countries, and songs.
The Elo rating mechanism is great for augmenting any list that needs sorting.
While Duelo is a tremendously fun prototype, ultimately it didn't solve my todo list woes.
I could sort my todo list effectively and effeciently with Duelo,
but I still found myself staring blankly at it wondering where to start.
