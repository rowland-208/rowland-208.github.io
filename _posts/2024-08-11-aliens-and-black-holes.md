My barber surprised me today.
We started talking about the space industry,
as we usually do.
I've been working in the space industry for five years now,
and he's passionate about it.

This led to a discussion of the possibility of alien life in our universe.
Again, this was no surprise to me.
He holds a vaguely spiritual belief that our observable universe is an experiment being conducted by aliens outside of it.
I tried to push empiricism on him, but he wasn't having it.

Now here's where the real surprise begins.
He started asking me questions like an inquisitive child.
We talked about the fine balance of Earth's gravity that allows space travel, but just barely.
We talked about the nature of black holes.
I explained to him that, contrary to popular belief,
General relativity says nothing about the inside of black holes.
It is nothing more than a place in the universe where our theories fail to tell us anything.
There could be nothing inside,
or there could be anything inside,
and what's inside does not have to obey the known laws of physics.
This all made sense to him and he was excited to learn.

Walking out of there it occurred to me that I am very fortunate.
I often take for granted the knowledge I have acquired in my life.
It rarely serves me, but it's beautiful when I stop and think about it.
Conversations like this one make me want to share more.
